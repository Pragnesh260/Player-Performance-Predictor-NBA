# Player-Performance-Predictor-NBA

This study investigates the relationship between NBA player performance and team success over the years from 1996 to 2022. The preliminary findings (through linear regression analysis) reveal that using player data such as assists, rebounds, and usage percentage, we can predict points scored by a player with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.28.
